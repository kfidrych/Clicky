# Pokemon Memory Clicky

## About
Pokemon Memory Clicky is a memory based game where the user attempts to click as many unique images as possible without repeating to acheive the highest consecutive unique clicks. 
The game ends when an pokemon is clicked more than once in a game.

## Instructions
The gameplay is fairly simple:
* Player starts the game by selecting a pokemon.
* The challenge begins with the second and subsequent attempts to select a unique pokemon. If the Player clicks next on a Pokemon they already selected, the game will end and the highscore will be adjusted if they beat their previous highscore.
* The Player's Score is updated with each unique Pokemon clicked and caught.
* Refresh the game using the Clicky Game button on the top of the page, or refresh your browser. Refreshing your browser will also reset your highscore however.
